7/7 tests failed. 


Test 1 

	Test was run on an RS3617xs with an NFS exported dir with RAID5+spare and BTRFS
	Non-Synology source was an NFS export from a FreeNAS box with ZFS
	A Debian vm was used in the middle with the NFS-exports mounted.

	FAIL: Test had 2% of the files (2/100) fail.

Test 2

	Same as Test 1 but over ISCSI

	FAIL: Test had 1% of the files (1/100) fail.

Test 3 
	Same as Test 1 but instead of copying the files over NFS to the Synology SCP was used.
	Src was still over NFS from the Debian vm
	MD5 hashes computed locally on the Synology over SSH

	FAIL: Test had 1% of the files (1/100) fail.

Test 4
	Same as Test 1 but instead of copying the files over NFS to the Synology 
	they were SCPd locally from the FreeNAS box to the Synology removing NFS/ISCSI from the equation.
	MD5 hashes computed locally on the Synology over SSH

	FAIL: Test had 2% of the files (2/100) fail.


Test 5

	Test was run on an DS1517+ with an NFS exported dir with RAID6 and EXT4
	Non-Synology source was a single hdd connected via USB to a debian server with EXT4

	FAIL: Test had 3% of the files (3/100) fail.

Test 6 
	Same as Test 3 but over ISCSI

	FAIL: Test had 2% of the files (2/100) fail.


Test 7

        The spare for the RAID5 array in the RS3617xs was used to create a single drive storage pool
        A btrfs volume was then created and the same test was redone over NFS.

        The single drive storage pool hashes were then compared to the original FreeNAS files.

        FAIL: Test had 4% of the files (4/100) fail.


Test Control

        Control test. Files copied over NFS from the FreeNAS box to a third party over the internet.
        If this works we can exclude any network problem. Especially since its over the internet :D

        PASS: All files matched



----

A hexdump comparison of an original file and a failed file in Test 4 shows the following,

< 367c9c50 6152 4b26 0f86 f883 946f 70ef 68e5 24c7
---
> 367c9c50 e152 4b26 0f86 f883 946f 70ef 68e5 24c7



One single byte has changed. From hex 61 to e1. This type of corruption will go unnoticed by most.

Other files show also a single byte being changed
